Eric Morley’s old pageant trophies glinted in a studio case while a grin from a tiny Set sketch crept across the screen.

In the Monsters, Inc. break room they argued gently about heritage, fame, and the odd comfort of shows that mix laughter, stars, and wonder."

A stranger introduced himself simply as Persons and told a cautionary tale about a Boojum that could mimic faces.

When they resumed, the Boojum had vanished and all that remained was a small folded map and the faint scent of salt now."
